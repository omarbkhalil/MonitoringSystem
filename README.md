This project using IOTStack was made on a rasberryPI as a host
I used several microcontrollers and sensors (Accelerometer , teperature...)
Create a vibration simulator because i dont have a sensor for that
Connected the devices with each others and with the pi using mosquitto and websockets
Configured everything in node red
If any alert detected will send an email through node mailer
